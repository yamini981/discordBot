# discordBot
To use this discord bot, you have to create a file named .env in the same location as where the python file is located. 
This .env file should include the following:

DISCORD_TOKEN = *insert your discord bot token here

DISCORD_GUILD = *insert your server name here

Or, if you don't want to create a new file, just replace everywhere in the file that says DISCORD_TOKEN with your actual discord token, and everywhere that says DISCORD_GUILD should be replaced with your server's name

This discord bot currently supports tictactoe only
